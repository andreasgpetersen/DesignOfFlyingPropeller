\chapter{Abstract}
This thesis focuses on building, programming, and controlling a novel type of drone design. The drone behaves like a helicopter rotor as it rotates around its z-axis to create the lift necessary to keep it airborne. The focus is on finishing the drone's basic properties, such as assembling the foundation for a prototype, establishing sensor measurements, form communication between CPU and microcontrollers, and control the drone's rotation. The drone will need to have an estimate of its position in its rotation and be able to control its rotational velocity. The solution is implemented through two tasks: 1) calculating the drone's position with a fusion of sensor data, and 2) analyzing the system to implement a controller. The proposed solution shows that the drone estimates its position with high accuracy at low speeds, but lacks in sampling frequency to maintain this at high rotational velocities. The modeled system is shown to be very similar to the real drone. Finally, the drone is implemented with a PD-controller and feed-forward branch. The controller is successful in regulating the motors' voltage to maintain a specific angular velocity.
